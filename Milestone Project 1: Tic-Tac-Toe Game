Milestone Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Requirements: 
    1.  Function: Print out a board. Set up board as list, where index 1-9 corresponds to a number on numpad, to get 3x3 board. (DONE)
    
    2.  Function: Take in player input and assign their marker as 'X' or 'O'. 
                  Use while loops to continually ask until I get the correct answer. (DONE)
                  
    3.  Function: Takes (on the board list object) a marker ('X' or 'O') and desired position (1-9) and assigns it to board (DONE)
    
    4.  Function: Takes in board and mark (X or O) and then checks to see if mark has won (DONE)
    
    5.  Function: Uses random module to randomly decide which player goes first. (DONE)
    
    6.  Function: returns boolean indicating whether space on board is freely available (DONE)
    
    7.  Function: Checks if board is full and returns a boolean. True = full, False = not full (DONE)
    
    8.  Function: Asks for player's next position (1-9), then uses Step 6's function to check if it's a free position. 
                  If so, return the position for later use. (DONE)
                  
    9.  Function: Asks player if they want to play again. Returns boolean True if player wants to play again. (DONE)
    
    10. Use while loops and functions I made to run the game.
    

- 3 by 3 grid (done)
   - basic solution = done
   - Goal: make the grid into a 3x3 list (array)
        - Two Dimensional List
- black background
- white lines
- Player 1 is Blue
- Player 2 is Yellow
- Winner is Green
