1. Write a brief description of all the Object Types and Data Structures we learned about:

    Numbers: Integers (whole numbers) and Floating Point Numbers (or "Floats", decimal numbers).

    Strings: A character or a sequence of characters (words, phrases, sentences, etc.).

    Lists: An ordered sequence of data types. They can be several types.

    Tuples: Immutable (unchangable) sequence of data types.

    Dictionaries: An unordered mapping of data that has a key and an associated value.


2. Numbers

Write an equation that uses multiplication, division, and exponent, addition, subtraction that is equal to 100.25.

  (100.25 - .25) / 10**1 * 10 + .25


3. Explain what the cell below will produce and why. Can you change it so the answer is correct?

2/3

  The answer is 0. Python 2 uses Classic Division, which truncates. 
  I can change it to 2.0/3 to get 0.6666666666666666.
  
  I can also use casting 2.
    float(2)/3
    
  I can also import from Python 3, which uses True Division
    from __future__ import division
      3/2
