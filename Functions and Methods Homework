1. Write a function that computes the voalume of a sphere given its radius.

2. Write a function that checks whether a number is in a given range (Inclusive of high and low)

  A. Print statement within range.
  
  B. Returns the boolean
  
3. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters
   and lower case letters.
   
      Sample String:  'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
      Expected Output:
          No. of Upper case characters: 4
          No. of Lower case characters: 33
          
4. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.

    Sample List: [1,1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
    
    Unique List: [1,2,3,4,5]


5. Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.

6. Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is a palindrome or not.

7. Write a Python function to check whether a string a pangram or not.

    Note: Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
    
      Example: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
      
      Hint: Look at the string module  
      
        import string
        
          def ispangram(str1, alphabet=string.ascii_lowercase):
              # do the rest
